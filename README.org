Combine el-get-bundle with use-package.

Add the ability to add :features to incorate an el-get-bundle parameter. Add the ability to add :pkgname when the el-get rcp name differs from the use-package name.

Below are some examples and optimizations:

Before
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(el-get-bundle swiper
  :features ivy)
(use-package ivy
  :config
... )

(el-get-bundle emacs-pug-mode)
(use-package pug-mode
  :config
... )
#+END_SRC

After
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(egb-use-package swiper
  :features ivy
  :pkgname ivy
  :config
... )

(egb-use-package emacs-pug-mode
  :pkgname pug-mode
  :config
... )
#+END_SRC

The following packages were where some inspiration from the code came from:

  - [[https://github.com/edvorg/req-package][req-package]]
  - [[https://github.com/jaccarmac/quse-package][quse-package]]

Enjoy.
